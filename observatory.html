    <p>The Secrets Observatory is a curiosity-driven institute for detecting, observing, studying, and explaining natural secrets of our world.</p>


    <p>Oftentimes, one encounters facts, things, or aspects of our natural surroundings that are not well known, even though they are extremely illuminating and very simple in nature.</p>

    <p>Our observatory aims at detecting these secrets and thoroughly studying them. This leads to clarity about them and a grasp of their essence, which is essential for these secrets to be spread to any curious minds by making them both accessible and understandable.</p>

    <p>We also enjoy trying out and playing around with things and concepts ourselves in our Lab.</p>

    <p>Now, you probably already asked yourself what we mean by secrets. This is a very good question, as there is no straightforward answer — they come in all kinds of forms and shapes.
        You are encouraged to read about secrets, for instance, in the following three books:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=MBK/85">Mathematical Understanding of Nature: Essays on Amazing Physical Phenomena and Their Understanding by Mathematicians</a></i> by V.I. Arnold</li>
        <li><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">Zero to One</a></i> by Peter Thiel</li>
        <li>or <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable">The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable</a></i> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, where you can compare black swans with the secrets.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Thus, a secret can be a brilliant person, a characteristic of our nature (for she is just so marvelous), or a naturally emerging phenomenon out of a certain social context.</p>
    <p>
      Finally, the connection of such secrets with entrepreneurial ventures is beutifully described by Paul Graham in his essey <i><a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/getideas.html">How to Get New Ideas</a>.
    </p>
    <p><i>
      "The way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies: what seems strange, or missing, or broken? You can see anomalies in everyday life (much of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for them is at the frontiers of knowledge.

Knowledge grows fractally. From a distance its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough to get close to one, you'll notice it's full of gaps. These gaps will seem obvious; it will seem inexplicable that no one has tried x or wondered about y. In the best case, exploring such gaps yields whole new fractal buds."
