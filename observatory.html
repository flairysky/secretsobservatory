    <p>The Secrets Observatory is a curiosity-driven institute for detecting, observing, studying, and explaining natural secrets of our world.</p>


    <p>Oftentimes, one encounters facts, things, or aspects of our natural surroundings that are not well known, even though they are extremely illuminating and very simple in nature.</p>

    <p>Our observatory aims at detecting these secrets and thoroughly studying them. This leads to clarity about them and a grasp of their essence, which is essential for these secrets to be spread to any curious minds by making them both accessible and understandable.</p>

    <p>We also enjoy trying out and playing around with things and concepts ourselves in our Lab.</p>

    <p>Now, you probably already asked yourself what we mean by secrets. This is a very good question, as there is no straightforward answer — they come in all kinds of forms and shapes.
        You are encouraged to read about secrets, for instance, in the following three books:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=MBK/85">Mathematical Understanding of Nature: Essays on Amazing Physical Phenomena and Their Understanding by Mathematicians</a> by V.I. Arnold</i></li>
        <li><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">Zero to One</a> by Peter Thiel</i></li>
        <li>or <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable">The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable</a> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb</i>, where you can compare black swans with the secrets.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Thus, a secret can be a brilliant person, a characteristic of our nature (for she is just so marvelous), or a naturally emerging phenomenon out of a certain social context.</p>
