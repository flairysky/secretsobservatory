## Reading Books in General

I guess that nobody ever told you to start reading a book from the first page and continue reading according to the page numbering, reading the second page next, then the third, and so on until you reach the very last page of the book.  
So why are you doing it?  
If you are not reading in this manner (or at least not always), I am proud of you.

I am not a fan of writings telling people how to do something—here, reading—while not actually showing in particular how to do it, so that one actually sees how satisfactory or useful it is. Here I make an exception, as I find the following information to be of some use despite not seeing it here in action.

One should become aware that one is not forced by anybody to read a book from the first page to the last page in a completely linear fashion. The way one chooses to read a book depends on the reader only. You are free to think!

Hence, we can, for instance, read the book linearly as stated above, or we can start at the last chapter and go backwards; we can start in the middle and go a few pages to the front and a few pages to the back, and so on; or we can start basically at any chapter and then go a few pages forward and look up terms we do not understand in previous chapters. The choice is yours.  
(You can read more on this topic, for instance, in *Basic Mathematics* [ref:Lang1988].)

Moreover, you can read completely as you wish, just skipping from a paragraph at the end of a chapter to the first paragraph of a different chapter or in any completely unordered and “rebellious” manner.

It was an interesting experience during a seminar at one of the universities I attended, where we were supposed to read a “hard-to-read” book, to see all the other students and professors read the book in a standard linear manner (also within individual chapters). Of course, I read in a “rebellious” manner, and when I told the other people, including the two very senior professors, how I read the book, it was met with laughter, which I found to just reflect their ignorance. Especially being a very senior professor, not only reading their whole life in a completely linear fashion but also laughing at people who read in different styles with the aim to understand the content better, I think reflects a lot about the person—which I will not go further into, and you can build your own opinion.

## On Reading Mathematics Books

Now, to read mathematics books is a little bit different.  
Usually, if a book is well written, then we should be able at the end to “see” a big picture of how all the stuff across the chapters is connected, so that when asked a question about it, we are able to intuitively (but rigorously) construct (from scratch) an argument to answer that question.  
Yet, since mathematics is not linear, this can rarely be done (in my experience) by reading a book in a linear fashion.

> “We all believe that mathematics is an art. The author of a book, the lecturer in a classroom, tries to convey the structural beauty of mathematics to his readers, to his listeners. In this attempt, he must always fail. Mathematics is logical to be sure, each conclusion is drawn from previously derived statements. Yet the whole of it, the real piece of art, is not linear; worse than that, its perception should be instantaneous. We have all experienced on some rare occasion the feeling of elation in realising that we have enabled our listeners to see at a moment's glance the whole architecture and all its ramifications.”  
> — Emil Artin [ref:ArtinE1957]

Thus, one usually needs to approach the book from different perspectives, each time with a different goal in mind (I would argue that it is all just psychology) and usually needs to read the book (or a chapter) several times, each time in a different manner.

## Common Reading Styles for Mathematical Books

Here I sum up some common ways to read (especially targeted to, but not only, math books).  
In these following reading styles, you can read the word *book* also as *chapter*, depending on the book and the context:

- **1st read:** Skim first through the whole book to get the general idea about what the book is about and how the topics are roughly connected (of course, only if you do not want to spoil the resolution at the end of the book).  
- **2nd read:** Go through the definitions and theorems (it is a great success if you understand what the theorems are telling you on the first read, i.e., immediately).  
- **3rd read:** Go through the proofs of the theorems, since now you should understand what they are telling you and also see some connections with the other theorems, so you have motivation for the proofs.  
- **4th read:** Skip back and forth and try to see connections between the topics so that you “see” the whole picture.

Obviously, we assume that you picked a book adequate for your mathematical maturity (or do you just want to be depressed?).  
For me, finding the right book means already half of the success.

## Rules of Thumb

And there may be some final rules of thumb:

1. **Do not be ashamed** to pick a book with a topic you “should” know.  
   (e.g. Just because you attended high school does not mean you should know everything about basic calculus. To show you an instance from my own experiences, I remember one time having the *Basic Mathematics* book by Serge Lang in my hand while passing by at one math department and being asked by other students what I was reading. I showed it to them and told them I wanted to look up some facts about Euclidean geometry. Without asking what, they laughed... again, you can make up your mind about the whole situation. For curious readers, I was looking up some details about group orbits and cycles.)  
   The book needs to be at a level you are comfortable with but still be challenging—just like in chess, where you ideally play against opponents who are slightly better than you so that you can improve but do not feel discouraged. If you pick an opponent who is too strong, you lose and feel discouraged; conversely, picking an opponent whom you can beat in a few simple moves does not improve your game and is boring.  
   Also, do not feel any social pressure. Just because other people tell you that you are learning some very basics and that it is for nothing—let them think that. You know why you picked the particular book.

2. **Do not be afraid; just trust the process and yourself.**  
   Do not be afraid to skip some topic if it does not fit your taste or you do not understand it at the moment, and do not be afraid to skip some technical details!  
   > “This skipping is another important point. It should be done whenever a proof seems too hard or whenever a theorem or a whole paragraph does not appeal to the reader. In most cases he will be able to go on, and later he may return to the parts which he skipped.”<br> — Emil Artin [ref:ArtinE1957], *in his Geometric Algebra*, about how to read the book.  

Do not be afraid to put the book aside even though you did not finish reading it. If it feels too much at some point, just go away from it and pick it up later, even after some weeks, months, or years.

3. **Sometimes, just because you do not understand *why* you are learning something or what its connections are with the rest of the topics,** does not necessarily mean it is not a good idea to learn it (at least on a manipulative level, so that you can work with that idea). Look up whether the topic shows up later in the book where you get the context and motivation to learn it and where you also see how it fits into the whole picture. (Caution: there can be several places later in the book, each telling you something new about the thing you are trying to understand.)

4. **Also, you may ask what is the difference between a “lemma,” a “theorem,” and a “corollary.”**  
   *Theorem* (from Latin *spectacle, sight*) means some sentence which should be of importance and should be proved, whereas *corollary* comes from Latin and means a *gift*. Hence it describes some result which follows immediately from our theorem in a simple way.  
   *Lemma* (from Greek *premise, assumption*) often describes some intermediary result that should help us prove the theorem.  
   Thus, when we want to prove some big result, we can often think of it as climbing some big mountain, say Mt. Everest, where we need first some intermediary results to have a base camp, and then some further results to make a path toward the peak. Then we can prove some big theorem, i.e., climb Mt. Everest.

5. **Lastly, always question everything.**  
   Just because it is written by some person with prizes does not mean it is correct until they show it to you (i.e., prove it to you).

## Concluding Thoughts

Reading and doing (not necessarily by writing) mathematics is to me analogous to playing sports, say, e.g. football.  
You can watch as many games as you want (and learn a lot!), but without trying to play it yourself, you will never be able to play it well, which is obviously the most fun.
