## Reading Books in General

I guess that nobody ever told you to start reading a book from the first page and continue reading according to the page numbering, reading the second page next, then the third, and so on until you reach the very last page of the book.  
So why are you doing it?  <br>
If you are not reading in this manner (or at least not always), I am proud of you.

One should become aware that one is not forced by anybody to read a book from the first page to the last page in a completely linear fashion. The way one chooses to read a book depends on the reader only. You are free to think!

Hence, we can, for instance, read the book linearly as stated above, or we can start at the last chapter and go backwards; we can start in the middle and go a few pages to the front and a few pages to the back; or we can start basically at any chapter and then go a few pages forward and look up terms we do not understand in previous chapters. The choice is yours.  
(You can read more on this topic, for instance, in *Basic Mathematics* [ref:Lang1988].)

Moreover, you can read completely as you wish, just skipping from a paragraph at the end of a chapter to the first paragraph of a different chapter or in any completely unordered and “rebellious” manner.

It was an interesting experience during a seminar at one of the universities I attended, where we were supposed to read a “hard-to-read” book, to see all the other students and professors read the book in a standard linear manner. Of course, I read in a “rebellious” manner, and when I told the other people, including the two very senior professors, how I read the book, it was met with laughter and craziness. You can build your own opinion about this incidence and about somebody in a very senior position, who not only was reading their whole life in a completely linear fashion but also laughs at people who read in different styles with the aim to understand the content better :)

## On Reading Mathematical Books

Now, reading mathematics books is a little bit different.  
Usually, if a book is _well written_, then we should be able to “see” a big picture at the end of the book displaying how all the stuff across the chapters is connected. Thus, when one is asked a question about the book, you are able to intuitively (but also rigorously) construct (from scratch) an argument to answer that question.  
Yet, since mathematics is not linear, this can rarely be done (in my experience) by reading a book in a linear fashion.

> “We all believe that mathematics is an art. The author of a book, the lecturer in a classroom, tries to convey the structural beauty of mathematics to his readers, to his listeners. In this attempt, he must always fail. Mathematics is logical to be sure, each conclusion is drawn from previously derived statements. Yet the whole of it, the real piece of art, is not linear; worse than that, its perception should be instantaneous. We have all experienced on some rare occasion the feeling of elation in realising that we have enabled our listeners to see at a moment's glance the whole architecture and all its ramifications.”<br>
>   
> Emil Artin [ref:ArtinE1957]

Thus, one usually needs to approach the book from different perspectives, each time with a different goal in mind (I would argue that it is all just psychology) and usually one needs to read the book (or a chapter) several times, each time in a different manner.

## Common Reading Styles for Mathematical Books

Here I sum up some common ways to read (especially targeted to, but not only, math books).  
In the following reading styles, you can read the word *book* also as *chapter*, depending on the book and the context. Also the reading styles are ordered so that when you start reading about a topic you have not learned before, you can follow the ordering, i.e. start with the first reading style and progress through the styles till you reach the fifth one.

- **1st read:** Skim first through the whole book to get the general idea about what the book is about and how the topics are roughly connected (of course, only if you do not want to spoil the resolution at the end of the book). Read the Preface first!
- **2nd read:** Go through the definitions and theorems (it is a great success if you understand what the theorems are telling you on the first read, i.e., immediately).  
- **3rd read:** Go through the proofs of the theorems, since now you should understand what they are telling you and also see some connections with the other theorems, so you have motivation for the proofs.  
- **4th read:** Skip back and forth and try to see connections between the topics so that you “see” the whole picture.
- **5th read:** When you already know the topic well, you should be able to read the book like a novel.

Obviously, it is assumed that you picked a book adequate for your mathematical maturity (or do you just want to be depressed?).  
For me, finding the right book means already half of the success.

## Rules of Thumb
A list with some suggestions:

1. **Do not be ashamed** to pick a book with a topic you “should” know.  
   (e.g. just because you attended high school does not necessarily that mean you know everything about basic calculus. To show you an instance from my own experiences, I remember one time having the *Basic Mathematics* book by Serge Lang in my hand while walking through one math department and being asked by other students what I was reading. I showed it to them. They laughed :) You can make up your mind about the whole situation. (For curious readers, I was looking up some details about group orbits and cycles this book presents in the most intuitive manner.)<br>
   The book needs to be at a level you are comfortable with but still be challenging — just like in chess, where you ideally play against opponents who are slightly better than you so that you can improve but do not feel discouraged. If you pick an opponent who is too strong, you lose and feel discouraged; conversely, picking an opponent who you can beat in a few simple moves does not improve your game and is boring.<br> 
   Also, do not feel any social pressure. Just because other people tell you that you are learning some very basics and that it is for nothing — let them think that. You know why you picked the particular book, and there was a reason behind the choice (at least I hope so).

2. **Do not be afraid; just trust the process and yourself.**  
   Do not be afraid to skip some topic if it does not fit your taste or you do not understand it at the moment, and do not be afraid to skip some technical details!<br>

   > “This skipping is another important point. It should be done whenever a proof seems too hard or whenever a theorem or a whole paragraph does not appeal to the reader. In most cases he will be able to go on, and later he may return to the parts which he skipped.”<br>
   >
   > Emil Artin [ref:ArtinE1957], *in his Geometric Algebra*, commenting on how to read his book.  

Do not be afraid to put the book aside even though you did not finish reading it. If it feels too much at some point, just go away from it and pick it up later, even after some weeks, months, or years.

3. **Sometimes, just because you do not understand *why* you are learning something or what its connections are with the rest of the topics,** does not necessarily mean it is not a good idea to learn it (at least on a manipulative level, so that you can work with that idea). Look up whether the topic shows up later in the book where you get the context and motivation to learn it and where you also see how it fits into the whole picture. (Caution: there can be several places later in the book, each telling you something new and different about the thing you are trying to understand.)

4. **You may be asking what is the difference between a “lemma,” a “theorem,” and a “corollary.”**  
   *Theorem* (from Latin *spectacle, sight*) means some sentence which should be of importance and should be proved, whereas *corollary* comes from Latin and means a *gift*. Hence it describes some result which follows immediately from our theorem in a simple way.  
   *Lemma* (from Greek *premise, assumption*) often describes some intermediary result that should help us prove the theorem.<br> 
   Thus, when we want to prove some big result, we can often think of it as climbing some big mountain, say Mt. Everest, where we need first some intermediary results to have a base camp, and then some further results to make a path toward the peak. Then we can prove some big theorem, i.e., climb Mt. Everest.

5. **Lastly, always question everything.**  
   Just because it is written by some person with prizes does not mean it is correct until they show it to you that it indeed is correcr (i.e., prove it to you).

## Concluding Thoughts

Reading and doing (not necessarily by writing) mathematics is to me analogous to playing sports, say, e.g. football.  
You can watch as many games as you want (and learn a lot!), but without trying to play it yourself, you will never be able to play it well, which is obviously the most fun.
