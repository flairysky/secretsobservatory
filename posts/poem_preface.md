>>> A life is a tragedy on close up and a comedy in longshot. | Charlie Chaplin (quote made famous by Sir Rowan Atkinson)

As the quote by two of my favorite geniuses shows, life is, for the most part, about our perspective on things — and it’s no different in mathematics.

But before we jump in, let me quickly describe the purpose and motivation behind this poem. They arose from my experiences with people interested in mathematics, as I found that the general perception of mathematics, and some of the fundamental basic notions I will describe, were taught in such a way that students across all levels (from undergraduate up to PhD) had such a good grasp of them that we were not able to study together, because we always had to circle back to clarify those basic notions.<br>
Moreover, since I was usually studying mathematics on my own but liked to be among people, I realized that whenever I studied with others, I had to invest around one to two hours going over these basic notions so we could have a common ground. And since all the students I studied with enjoyed and highly valued this kind of teaching, I decided to write down these notes.

You might be wondering why are these notes called a poem, which I now briefly state here and will ellaborate about the choice more in detail later. The reason is very simple. As with everything in life, we love stories and narratives, and I am no exception. Whenever I learn something or try to grasp an idea, I try to understand the narrative behind it. Luckily for us, in mathematics the narrative writes itself and in contrast to other stories, mathematics must follow logic. And so, although we still have different ways of approaching these topics, they all share a common thread: logical coherence. The way I portray the story is simply the way I like it, and so resembles my taste.

Moreover, since these notes reflect my subjective my perception, it is fair to briefly state what my view of mathematics is, and why the word poem was chosen. So let’s start with the latter.

The word poem was chosen for two main reasons.

Firstly, to me, doing mathematics is something completely different from the general perception of mathematics in the public and has nothing to do with what is being taught at schools and most universities (at least in my experience).

I cannot sympathize more with the following quote from Eisenstein:

> “I still remember the torture of completing endless multiplication examples. From this, you
might conclude, erroneously, that I lacked mathematical ability, merely because I showed little inclination for calculating. In fact, the mechanical, always repetitive nature of the procedures annoyed me,
and indeed, I am still disgusted with calculations without any purpose, while if there was something new
to discover, requiring thought and reasoning, I would spare no pains. I understood the form of grammar
and languages with ease as I did everything that could be comprehended in a logical way.”

For me, doing mathematics has nothing to do with numbers (honestly, I am not really a fan of them) but is all about the ideas and the psychological perception of these ideas, about their connections and their ultimate depiction in a unified way. Again, here I can cite Eisenstein:

> “Soon I became used to advancing deeper from single
theorems into a wider context and understanding theories as a unity. Thus the idea of a mathematical beauty dawned upon me. For mathematical beauty exists in the same way that aesthetic beauty does. It is
a beauty which can only be understood if one is able, with full enthusiasm, to see the complete picture — a
whole system of discoveries, all following a main idea and leading to a final result, all linked together in
harmony and ingenuity, to form an organic entirety, just like a painting. There is also a mathematical
rhythm or taste, which reads the analysis and then leads the approach and the development accordingly.”

Eisenstein is not alone in this perception of mathematics, since many great mathematicians describe math as an art[#1]. But calling these sessions "art sessions" feels too loose to me. Since poems can be completely logical in contrast to art in general, as far as I know. Thus, I decided to perceive these notes poems.

> "Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas." <br>
> Einstein

The reasoning behind the name also intends to take away the negative perception and as Serge Lang calls them "uptight feelings" of (the word) mathematics and so maybe lure some people to read them who would otherwise immediatelly close the notes when they would see this particular word in the title.

Also, it should be mentioned that the word “mathematics” has nothing to do with numbers, as it comes from the ancient Greek mathema, meaning “that which is learned” or “what one gets to know.”

Finally, as stated above, the poems potray my personal subjective perspective on mathematics, and so before we start, I should also mention that my way of doing mathematics was mainly influenced by Serge Lang, and secondly by the Artin family, in particular Emil Artin[#2] and Michael Artin[#3]. 
Thus, being one of the lucky people who learned from Serge, I could largly profit from his algebraic mastery  and geotric intuition (probably comming from his physics background), which I hope I was able to at least partially acquire myself.

Also, I do not take a view of any particular traditional school, such as the french one lead by Bourbaki's abstraction, nor the Russian one treating mathematics as part of experimental sciences, but rather prefer to take the best of both worlds[#4]. Also, unlike for instance Bourbaki, who does not provide you with any explenation why he did the things the way he decided to do[#5], I will try to give explenations why I decided to do things the way I did them when deemed adequate. I find it to be quite dishonest behavior towards the readers to keep from them the motivation behind __why__ I took a particular path when I could have taken another one, since mostly there is a reason (and so, also some learnings) behind the most choices we make.

Consequently, althogh my perspective heavily relies on Serge's and Artins' teachings, I developed my own views and perceptions of the subject according to my personal taste. But without developing your own understanding - do you even have a soul?

And so one of my hopes for these poems is to a certain degree analogous to what Serge's motivation for his textbooks was

> "I want to stimulate thought, and do away with the general uptight feelings, which people often have about math" [ref:Lang1988] 

and that you will see that you can use your **ordinary language** to express the mathematical ideas.

>>> The question of the usefulness of poetry arises only in periods of its decline, while in periods of its flowering, no one doubts its total uselessness. | Boris Pastrnak

## On the structure and types of the poems

Loosly speaking I differentiate among 3 poem types below, where each poem will take ideally a form of one of them. However, crossovers are not excluded.

1. Abstract perspective poem (providing a big picture understanding)
2. Detailed perspective poem (providing an understanding of some special topic)
3. Durchblick perspective poem (going through the different abstraction layers)

As you can see I have included a word Durchblick (from German, meaning something like "through-view", but there is no exact translation or word in english that would capture this notion in the same way.). This inclusion of words coming from different languages inevitably must happen over and over, as a result of historical developments of mathematics, in order to express and understand the ideas as accuratelly as possible. Oftentimes, once one understands where the name came from, one understands the idea behind the name and oftentimes the name came from languages other than English.
