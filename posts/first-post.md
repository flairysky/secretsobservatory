**Welcome words** 

Hereby I would like to welcome you to this blog where notes in progress on various topics are shared.

## New Features

This blog now supports **ScienceDirect-style references and footnotes**![#1] 

For example, research on PARP enzymes[ref:vyas2014family] shows fascinating results in DNA repair mechanisms. You can also add mathematical content with references[ref:example2023math]:

$\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$

Click any reference number to see a popup with the full citation — no need to scroll down!

## Try It Yourself

- **View** the popup that appears on the right (desktop) or bottom (mobile)
- **Check** the references section at the bottom of this post
