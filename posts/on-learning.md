>>> Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning. | William Arthur Ward[ref:Ward1973] 

This is a never-ending ongoing collection of learning tips and tricks.

1. **Start with Confidence-Builders**  
   - Start always with a confidence builder, which means you start with some things that are easy for you and, ideally, give you some routine or something to get started and get into the topics you want to study for.  
   - It’s usually the best way to gain confidence. It doesn’t have to be a lot; it can be just five minutes or something, but it would be good.  
   - For instance, you can repeat some basics. Let’s say you want to study something about vector spaces. It’s not a bad idea to repeat the axioms of vector spaces or homomorphisms between vector spaces.  
   - I wouldn’t necessarily suggest doing any exercises, because they require energy, but I would suggest going over these topics—the basic, fundamental topics—to understand and repeat them. It’s a good idea to start with.  
   - If you’re studying from a book or something, it’s usually not a bad idea to just read the first few pages of a chapter to get into the topic, repeat some basics, and build your confidence that you know what you’re doing. Then go on to new topics.

2. **Avoid Learning Topics in Isolation**  
   - Don’t let things stay isolated. Even if a topic is presented on its own, like a specific function, try to see the big picture.  
   - Learning isolated topics is harder because you need to memorize many different things. But once you compactify them and put them into a general or abstract concept, it becomes easier to associate them with what you already know.  
   - For example, is the function even or odd? Positive or negative?  
   - Consider \(x^2\) and \(e^x\): both are positive functions—or, more precisely, non-negative functions, since \(x^2\) can be zero.  
   - Are they both convex or concave functions? Are they both continuous on some domain? We know they are both continuous functions.  
   - Now, continuous functions form a vector space. So any function we encounter that is continuous can also be treated as a vector in a vector space.  
   - These are observations you should make because learning like this will make it much easier to remember things.

3. **Compactify Knowledge**  
   - Try to compactify things. By that, I mean try to never learn topics in isolation.  
   - Two and three are basically interconnected, because by compactifying I mean you try to learn the new topics through the lens of the topics you already know. So you don’t try to completely reinvent the wheel but use what you know and then translate the new stuff into the language of the old stuff.  
   - For instance, if you’re learning about polynomials, you immediately see that they satisfy the ring structure. But since we also have constants in there, and we can multiply polynomials together and by constants, this means we have a vector space structure too.  
   - This allows us to use everything we know about vectors for polynomials and gives us an immediate geometric interpretation of polynomials.  
   - Here, we see two things: we can understand polynomials through the lens of vector spaces or rings, and second, by seeing them as a vector space or even as a ring, we compactify them because we have an algebraic structure to manipulate them.

4. **Choose Appropriately Challenging Material**  
   - It doesn’t make sense to start with extremely difficult things if you haven’t learned the prerequisites. Learning should be like playing a chess game: always choose an opponent who is better than you, but only a little bit.  
   - This way, you can improve and enjoy the process. If you choose an opponent who is too good, it will not be fun for them—or for you, since losing every time and seeing no improvement is discouraging.  
   - Similarly, when studying, choose the right book or material that matches your level but still provides a slightly abstract perspective or introduces new concepts.  
   - However, it doesn’t hurt to look at very advanced material occasionally. For example, if you play basketball, it’s probably not a good idea to play directly against Steph Curry. But you can watch him, study how he holds the ball, where he looks, or how he positions his feet when shooting.  
   - Similarly, even if you’re at an undergraduate level in analysis or algebra, it doesn’t hurt to browse graduate-level texts. While you may not understand everything, it provides guidance and shows where your current learning leads.  
   - You might occasionally manage to solve an advanced exercise, but don’t expect to do them all. Think of it as landing a lucky three-pointer against a professional basketball player—it’s rare, but it happens.

5. **Do Not Shy Away from Learning from Other Players**  
   - Everyone has an idol in their field, whether it’s in sports or academics. But it doesn’t hurt to look at other players (or authors) as well.  
   - For example, your favorite player might have the best shooting technique, but another player might have the best game overview, dribbling skills, or passing abilities.  
   - Similarly, while you may look up to one author, it’s helpful to consult other books or authors, especially if your primary source is difficult to understand. Different perspectives or techniques can make the material more accessible.  
   - For example, if there’s a proof you don’t understand, look at alternative proofs. It’s fine to pick one that makes sense to you, especially when encountering new material for the first time.  
   - Over time, this approach will give you a broader understanding and make learning more effective.

6. **Don’t Worry About Not Understanding Everything at First Try**  
   - You don’t need to understand everything on the first read, especially if you’re reading a topic or starting to learn a new topic for the first time.  
   - If there are things you don’t immediately understand, or even after 5 or 10 seconds of thinking you still don’t understand, don’t worry about them, especially when it comes to proofs.  
   - If a proof is too difficult or complex, start by skipping it and go directly to exercises. Apply the theorem to get an intuitive feeling for it, understand its importance, and see what it tells you.  
   - Once the theorem feels intuitive and you grasp its essence, go back to the proof and try to understand it.  
   - Similarly, if you’re starting a new topic, you can skip the proofs entirely at first. Focus on the theorems and definitions. Try to understand them and, if possible, apply some of the theorems to gain familiarity.  
   - Once you’re confident about the terms and their meaning, revisit the proofs. This approach allows you to build a solid foundation without getting overwhelmed at the beginning.

7. **Never Forget to Have Fun**  
   - Always remember to enjoy the journey of learning. This is one of the most important aspects of studying.  
   - Even if a topic doesn’t seem fun at first, find ways to make it enjoyable. Create a story about the topic, explain it to friends, or find an interesting detail that sparks your curiosity.  
   - Try to apply the topic to a real-world situation or something practical to make it more engaging.  
   - When choosing books, remember that everyone has different preferences and styles. Find the style and authors that fit you best. This may take some experience, but by reading a variety of books, you’ll discover which authors resonate with you and help you understand the material most effectively.  
   - Try to learn with other people. Learning with others can make studying more fun and provide new perspectives. Explaining the topic to someone else is engaging, and you can also try to see the topic from their point of view.  
   - Usually, the things you struggle with are the same things they struggle with, and vice versa. This helps you realize that learning is challenging for everyone and that you’re not alone. Discussing topics together and helping each other makes the process more enjoyable and effective—after all, we’re social creatures, and learning together is a natural and rewarding experience.
