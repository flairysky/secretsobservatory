>>> Those who were thirsty for knowledge traveled immense distances. | Lorraine Daston [Das25]

## Opening with Epigraphs

The quote above is an **epigraph** — a short quotation at the beginning of a chapter, essay, or section that suggests its theme. They're commonly used in academic writing to set the intellectual tone.

## Different Quote Styles

### 1. Epigraph (Centered, Elegant)

Use this for opening quotes or thematic statements:

>>> The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. | Henri Poincaré

### 2. Standard Blockquote (Left-aligned)

Use this for longer quotations within your text:

> Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things. The role of the mathematician is to find these points of resemblance, to classify them, to deduce them from one another.
> 
> — Henri Poincaré

### 3. Inline Quote with Citation

For shorter quotes, you can simply use quotation marks: According to Daston[ref:Das25], "those who were thirsty for knowledge traveled immense distances."

## Simple Markdown Syntax for Epigraphs

To add an epigraph to your post, just use this simple syntax:

```
>>> Your quote text here | Author Name [Ref]
```

The `>>>` at the start signals an epigraph, and the `|` separates the quote from the author attribution.

**Examples:**

```
>>> In mathematics, you don't understand things. You just get used to them. | John von Neumann

>>> God created the integers; all else is the work of man. | Leopold Kronecker

>>> The essence of mathematics is its freedom. | Georg Cantor [Ref23]
```

The epigraph automatically:
- Centers the text
- Applies italic styling  
- Adds proper spacing
- Works in both light and dark mode
- Is responsive on mobile devices

## Tips for Using Epigraphs

1. **Place at the beginning** — Epigraphs work best at the start of a post or major section
2. **Keep them short** — Aim for 1-3 sentences maximum
3. **Make them relevant** — Choose quotes that genuinely relate to your topic
4. **Cite properly** — Include the author and reference if applicable
5. **Don't overuse** — One or two per post is usually enough

## Combining Quotes with References

You can integrate references into epigraph attributions:

>>> In mathematics, you don't understand things. You just get used to them. | John von Neumann, as quoted in Zukav[ref:example2023math]

This creates a beautiful, professional look while maintaining academic rigor—all with simple markdown syntax!
